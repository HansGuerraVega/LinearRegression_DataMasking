# Project description
Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of machine learning and asks you to evaluate this possibility.

Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing.
Task 2: Predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a trained prediction model perform better than an untrained dummy model? Can it perform worse? Explain your answer.
Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance benefits a new customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model.
Task 4: Protect customer personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.
It is necessary to develop a data transformation algorithm that makes it difficult to recover personal information if the data falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, the data must be protected in such a way that the quality of the machine learning models is not affected. It is not necessary to choose the best model, it is enough to demonstrate that the algorithm works correctly.

## Project Instructions

Load the data.
Verify that the data is free of issues: no missing data, no outliers, etc.
Work through each task and answer the questions posed in the project template.
Draw conclusions based on your experience working on the project.

## Data Description
The dataset is stored in the file insurance_us.csv.

Characteristics: sex, age, salary, and number of family members of the insured person.
Objective: Number of insurance benefits received by an insured person in the last five years.
